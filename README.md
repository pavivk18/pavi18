# Major Project: Doctors Visit â€“ Problem Statements

## Overview
This project analyzes healthcare data to uncover patterns related to hospital visits, illness, demographics, and insurance coverage. The goal is to derive actionable insights that can help healthcare providers, insurance companies, policy makers, and public health organizations make informed decisions. The analysis focuses on factors such as income, illness severity, gender, and the impact of healthcare policies.

## Problem Statements
The project aims to solve the following key problems:
- **Data Cleaning**: Identifying and handling duplicates in the dataset.
- **Illness Distribution**: Categorizing people based on the count of illness.
- **Gender-Based Health Analysis**: Comparing illness distribution between genders.
- **Income and Health**: Analyzing the impact of income on health outcomes.
- **Activity Reduction**: Analyzing how illness impacts reduced activity days based on gender.
- **Missing Data**: Identifying and visualizing missing values.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Exploring relationships between health-related variables.
- **Income vs. Visits**: Understanding how income affects hospital visits.
- **Illness and Gender**: Comparing the illness impact based on gender.
- **Health Insurance Analysis**: Visualizing the percentage of people with government vs private health insurance.
- **Reduced Activity Visualization**: Visualizing reduced activity days by gender.
- **Health Status and Activity**: Correlating health status with reduced activity using a heatmap.

## Project Description
This project aims to provide insights into how various factors such as income, illness, and gender influence healthcare outcomes. We analyze a dataset containing information about hospital visits, patient demographics, health conditions, and insurance coverage.

### Scope of Work:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and duplicates.
- Descriptive and correlation analysis of key healthcare factors.
- Visualizations to present insights in a meaningful way.
- Exploring the relationship between illness, activity reduction, income, and healthcare access.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and processing.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
  - **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
  - **Seaborn**: For advanced visualizations such as heatmaps.
- **Development Tools**:
  - **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis.
  - **VS Code**: For code development and organization.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about:
- **Visits**: Number of hospital visits.
- **Demographics**: Gender, age, income.
- **Health**: Illness severity, reduced activity, health insurance status.
  
## End Users
- **Healthcare Providers**: Optimize services and resources based on patient needs.
- **Insurance Companies**: Tailor insurance products and improve customer targeting.
- **Policy Makers**: Improve healthcare policies for vulnerable populations.
- **Researchers**: Conduct further studies on healthcare access and illness distribution.
- **Public Health Organizations**: Improve healthcare access and coverage for at-risk groups.
